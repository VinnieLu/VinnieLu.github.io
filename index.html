<p class="other_Fan_Page">Check out this other Michael Fassbender tribute page by clicking <a class="link" href="http://www.michaelfassbender.org/">here</a>. It has Michael's photo as a backdrop that sits underneath the links, which I don't know how to do yet. It also has the text stylized with an interesting font, which I don't know how to do yet. It also has the text in a cool scroll mode, where the background photo stays put and the text scrolls over it, which I don't know how to do yet. It also has lots of great candid photos that I didn't find at first on Google. I don't like how the text gets lost sometimes in the background color.</p>
